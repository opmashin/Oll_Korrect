Actions are hard, and regrettable. Its hard to keep up with the decisions you make.
So many factors influencing it, emotions being one of them, but also being a feedback to the emotions.
Derive the Action from the random processes around.
Thats the only way to attain the true detachment.

But what is life if we give up on making Actions as will ?
Only the emotions and the decision we make.

Starting today, random events from around the world will trigger my daily actions.
